# Introduction
A set of Python programs and applications. As an entry level developer, I have created this set of Python programs. The 
folder contains six Python scripts and a .txt file. The scripts are the following:

## interval.py
This Python program calculates the maximum and minimum intervals from a list of spaces provided by the user.
A space is defined as a pair of start and end points, and the program finds the space or spaces with the longest
and shortest lengths based on these intervals.

## matrixMax.py
This is a Random Matrix Generator with Maximum Element Finder. A Python program which generates a random matrix based 
on user input and then calculates and displays the maximum element in the matrix.

## matrixOnes.py
An Identity Matrix Generator with Error Handling. This Python program generates and displays an identity matrix.
An identity matrix is a square matrix where all diagonal elements are '1's, and all other elements are '0's. The 
user specifies the number of '1's in the matrix.

## root.py
A Digital Root Calculator with Iterated Summing. This program calculates the digital root of a given integer using 
iterative digit summing. The digital root is the repeated sum of the digits of a number until a single-digit result
is obtained.
