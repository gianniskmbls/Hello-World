# Introduction
I am a computer science graduate with a particular interest in Python. Transitioning from a background in History and Philosophy of Science, I decided to take a significant turn in both my academic and professional life. After receiving my Masterâ€™s degree in Informatics, I wish to apply my new skills and knowledge as a computer science professional. This is my first GitHub repository.
